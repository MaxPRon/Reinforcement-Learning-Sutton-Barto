# Project: K-armed bandit testbed
#
# Description: This is an implementation of the k-armed banddit testbed
# as described in Richard S. Sutton and Andrew Barto's book "Reinforcement Learning".
# It simulates a k-armed bandit with a variable Reward structure and serves to test
# the performance of different Reinforcement Algorithms
#
# Author: Max Ronecker

# Notes 
# init function: set up the bandits ( k number, n testruns, mean, variance)
# run_test: run the test
# receive_action

# plot_results
# print_results
