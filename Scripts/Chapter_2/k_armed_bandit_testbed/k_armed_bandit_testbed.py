# Project: K-armed bandit testbed
# Description: This is an implementation of the k-armed banddit testbed
# as described in Richard S. Sutton and Andrew Barto's book "Reinforcement Learning".
# It simulates a k-armed bandit with a variable Reward structure and serves to test
# the performance of different Reinforcement Algorithms
